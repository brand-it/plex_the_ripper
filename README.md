Plex The MKVMaker Ripper

Currently this only work on Mac... Also you need to [download MKV](https://www.makemkv.com/download/makemkv_v1.14.2_osx.dmg)
The goal it to hopefully make it work on windows as well. But I have to keep working on that. 


## Setup
```shell
git clone https://github.com/newdark/plex_the_ripper.git
```

# Usage 

If you want to just rip a movie. 

```shell
bin/rip
```

If you have questions about the options uses the help. That has most of the update documentation.
```shell
bin/rip --help
```
